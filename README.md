# Personal Portfolio Version 1

In order to get accepted into a Programming Bootcamp, I was asked to create a simple Portfolio, explaining a few things about myself, my vision and goals as well as the reason why I wanted to join the Bootcamp. 

This was also my first Github Repository and also my very first time working with HTML and CSS. Here's a sneak peak into the project:
